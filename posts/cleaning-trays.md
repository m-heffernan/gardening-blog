# Why Clean Seedling Trays

Cleaning seedling trays is an important step in planting seeds. It helps prevent against bacterial and fungal diseases that could harm young seedlings. Nothing is worse than being excited for your young seedlings and then seeing them die off.

This year I decided to perform the cleaning of my seedling trays in the fall so that I am ready to plant right away when I want to.

# Approach

I read a couple of different ways to clean seedling trays online and decided to go with the following:

- First clean/scrub the trays in a soap solution
- Let the containers soak in a bleach solution

I didn't love the idea of using bleach but I had done it in the past and the ease of letting stuff soak is super great.

## Cleaning in a Soapy solution

For this step I used a 5 gallon paint bucket I had laying around and filled it with soap and water. The soap I used was Dr. Bronner's pure-castille soap which I still had a bunch leftover from dealing with an aphid problem in the Spring. To get tough soil residue off I grabbed a toothbrush.

## Soaking in Bleach Solution

After cleaning the trays initially I repurposed the 5 gallon paint bucket for the bleach solution. The recipe was a simple 9 parts water with one part bleach.

During this process the actual trays themselves didn't fit in the bucket so I sprayed them down with a bleach solution cleaning spray that I have.

After making sure everything is properly dunked in the solution, I set a timer for 25 min.
