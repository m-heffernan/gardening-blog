# The Plan

Since my tree seedling is out of the ground, it could be damaged during the winter. To avoid this, I put together a plan to protect the little guy from possible winter damage.

# My Tree Buddy

During the summer I noticed a small little seedling growing in the tomato plant. When I looked closer, I noticed that the seedling was coming out of a maple seed. I had previous lost Oak seedlings to ravaging squirrels earlier so jumped at the opportunity to grow a baby tree.

From some basic research, the tree looks like a red maple which while not unique is honestly perfect for what I'm trying to do. The tree grows fast and is tolerant of a lot of soils and is well suited for my area.

Luck permitting, the tree will continue to grow and can be transplanted to our dream yard when Phoebe and I move out of the city.

# Approach

Online it looks like the biggest threat to the tree outside of the ground is damage to the roots around 20 degrees farenheit. There were a couple of different approaches outlined:

- Bury the tree in the ground for the winter
- Store in a cool spot that doesn't freeze
- Make a warm enclosure

Since the tree is potted in a canvas bag I was worried about the roots growing through the canvas and into the surrounding dirt if it was burried. Also, land is a premium where I live so didn't want to have potential conflicts come Spring.

The idea of storing the plant inside was interesting but felt nervous about not having an inside spot with any sunlight for an extended period of time.

That left me with insulating the plant for Winter. To insulate the plant I placed the tree in a larger pot and stuffed leaves tightly all around it like a blanket. The leaves won't be as warm as actual soil but with so many leaves in our backyard I liked using a free resource.

# What to watch for

The biggest risk is that the leaves aren't warm enough for the plant. An option I have to mitigate this risk is to bring the plant inside on days where the temperatures drop below 20 degrees.
